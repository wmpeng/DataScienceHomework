My homework include a Vistual Studio 2015 project folder, a An executable file, three parameter files named "A.txt", "B.txt", "S.txt", and a readme file that you are reading.

The source code's path is ".\DataScienceHomework\DataScienceHomework\smithWaterman.cpp".

The executable file is "DataScienceHomework.exe"

# 3 Run Process

The process can run without installation.

## 3.1 Input and parameters

You can run the executable file in Powershell by command line like this : DataScienceHomework <1stFile> <2ndFile> <3rdFile>

<1stFile> and <2ndFile> are the first and the second DNA sequences file that only contain upper case letter {A,T,G,C} (line breaks are allowed).

<3rdFile> talls the scoring matrix and gap penalty ,whose format likes that：

```
scoreMatrix:
  A	T	G	C
A	1	-2	-2	-2
T	-2	1	-2	-2
G	-2	-2	1	-2
C	-2	-2	-2	1

GapPenalty:
-2
```

↑ When the SingleGapPenalty isn't define ,which is default ↑

```
scoreMatrix:
...

GapPenalty:
-1 -2 -3 -4
```
↑ When the SingleGapPenalty isn't define ,which is default ↑

## 3.2 Output

The result will be output at screen. When the the parameter files are the sample files, the result is :

```
highest value is 18.000000
sequences 1 from  1758 to  1784 : GAAGTTGAGCACGTAAGGCCTACGTTC
sequences 2 from  2004 to  2030 : GAAGTTGAGCACGTGATGCCTAAGTTC
```
